    <h2>NOTES:</h2>
    <p>
        <i>process the information in a form on the 'front end' before it is sent to the server using JavaScript</i>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each form control has an initial value that can be specified in the HTML code. </li>
        <li>This value can be changed by a user entering information or interacting with the form's interface (such as using a slider to increase or decrease a value).</li> 
        <li> The value can also be changed dynamically using JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>use JavaScript to interact with the forms.</b></p>

    <h2>Accessing Form Elements</h2>
    <p>to access to an specific form:</p>
    <p>const form = document.forms['search'];</p>
    <p>accessing to all the elements contained in the form:</p>
    <p><b>.elements  --- method</b></p>
    <p>const [input,button] = form.elements;</p>
    <p>access the form controls using their 'name' attributes as if it was a property of the form object. <br>
        for example, the input field has a name attribute of searchInput and can be accessed using this code:</p>
    <p>const input = form<b>.searchInput</b></p>
    <section>
        <h2>Form Properties and Methods</h2>
        <p>used to interact with the form.</p>
        <p><i>A form can be <b>submitted manually</b> by the user employing a <b>button</b> or <b>input element</b> <br>
            with a type <b>attribute of submit</b>, or even an <b>input element with a type attribute of image</b></i>
        </p>
        <h3><mark>form.action</mark> property</h3>
        <p>to <b>set the action attribute of a form</b>, so it's sent to a different URL to be processed on the server:</p>
        <p>form.action = '/an/other.url'</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Form Events</h2>
        <p><b>preventDefault()</b> <br>stop the form from being submitted to a dummy URL</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Retrieving and Changing Values From a Form</h2>
        <p><i>Text input element objects have a <b>value property</b> that can be used to retrieve the text inside the field.</i></p>
        <p>It's also possible to set the value using JavaScript. Example: <br>
        input.value ='Search Here' <br>
        The problem with this is that the text remains in the field when the user clicks inside it, <br> so it has to be deleted before 
        the user can enter their own text. This is easily remedied using the focus and blur event handlers. <br>
        
        input.addEventListener('focus', function(){ <br>
            if(input.value === 'search Here') { <br>
                input.value = '';<br>
            }<br>
        },false);<br>
        
        input.addEventListener('blur', function(){<br>
            if(input.value === '') {<br>
                input.value = 'search here';<br>
            }<br>
        }, false);<br>
        <br>
        Similar functionality can be produced in modern browsers using the <b>placeholder attribute</b> in the HTML markup. <br>
        <b>slightly different behavior:</b> <br>
        the placeholder text is not actually a value of the input field, so it won't be submitted as the field's value if the user fails to fill it in.
