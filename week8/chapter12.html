    <h1>Week 8 Notes</h1>
    <h2>APIs: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>
    <h2>Canvas API</h2>
    <p>draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript.</p>
    <p>
      improve the performance of our websites by avoiding the need to download
      images off the network.
    </p>
    <p>manipulate pixels in images and even video.</p>
    <h3>Creating a canvas Element</h3>
    <p>add a canvas element to the page</p>
    <p>
      drawing on the canvas is done using JavaScript-grab the element from the
      DOM-- giving our canvas an ID
    </p>
    <p>
      canvas element takes both a width and height attribute, which must also be
      set.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i>Note: Why not set width and height using CSS?</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we don't specify width and height, the canvas element will default to a
      width of 300 and a height of 150. If we set the width and height for a
      canvas only in CSS, the canvas element will be 300 by 150
    </p>
    &lt; canvas id="myCanvas" class="myCanvas" width="200" height="200"&gt;
    <br />
    Sorry! Your browser doesn't support Canvas. <br />
    &lt;/canvas&gt;
    <p>give it some kind of borde</p>
    <canvas id="myCanvas" class="myCanvas" width="200" height="200">
      Sorry! Your browser doesn't support Canvas.
    </canvas>
    <p>stored our canvas element in a variable on JS</p>
    <p>var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");</p>
    <p>set up the canvas's context</p>
    <p>El contexto es el lugar donde se representa su dibujo.</p>
    <p>
      <b
        >obtain our drawing context by calling the
        <mark>getContext method</mark> and passing it the string "2d", since
        we'll be drawing in two dimensions:</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>var context = canvas.getContext("2d");</p>
    <p>
      The object that's returned by getContext is an instance of
      CanvasRenderingContext2D.
    </p>
    <p>Filling Our Brush with Color</p>
    <h3>strokeStyle or fillStyle properties</h3>
    <p>
      Both strokeStyle and fillStyle are set on a context object, and both take
      one of three values: a string representing a color, a CanvasGradient
      object, or a CanvasPattern object
    </p>
    <p>use a color string to style the stroke.</p>
    <p>context.strokeStyle = "red";</p>
    <p>
      the stroke as the border of the shape you're going to draw. To draw a
      rectangle with a red border, we first define the stroke color
    </p>
    <p>context.strokeStyle = "red";</p>
    <p>
      To draw a rectangle with a red border and blue fill, we must also define
      the fill color
    </p>
    <p>context.fillStyle = "blue";</p>
    <p>
      We can use any CSS color value to set the stroke or fill color, as long as
      we specify it as a string
    </p>
    <h3>Drawing a Rectangle to the Canvas</h3>
    <p>calling the fillRect and strokeRect methods.</p>
    <p>
      these methods take the
      <b><mar>X and Y coordinates where you want to begin drawing</mar></b>
      the fill or the stroke, and <b>the width and height of the rectangle</b>.
    </p>
    <p>from the left of the canvas's top-left corner</p>
    <p>
      context.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 100); <br />
      context.strokeRect(10, 10, 100, 100);
    </p>
    <h3>Note: The Canvas Coordinate System</h3>
    <p>
      In the canvas coordinate system, the top-left corner is (0,0). If the
      canvas is 200 pixels by 200 pixels, then the bottom-right corner is
      (200,200)
    </p>
    <canvas id="demo2" width="200" height="200">
      Sorry! Your browser doesn't support Canvas.
    </canvas>
    <h3>create a CanvasPattern</h3>
    <p>calling the createPattern method.</p>
    <p>
      two parameters: the image to create the pattern with, and how that image
      should be repeated.
    </p>
    <p>a new function called drawPattern</p>
    <p>
      After doing the basics (grabbing the canvas and the context and setting a
      stroke)
    </p>
    <p>create an Image object and set its src property to our image</p>
    <p>
      function drawPattern() { <br />
      var canvas = document.getElementById("demo2");<br />
      var context = canvas.getContext("2d");<br />
      context.strokeStyle = "red";<br />
      <br />
      var img = new Image(); <br />
      img.src = "../images/bg-bike.png";<br />
      }
    </p>
    <p>
      <b
        ><mark
          >use the image's onload property to create our pattern once the image
          has been fully loaded by the browser</mark
        ></b
      >
    </p>
    <p>img.onload = function()</p>
    <p>
      In our onload event handler, we call createPattern, passing it the Image
      object and the string repeat so that our image repeats along both the X
      and Y axes. We store the results of createPattern in the variable pattern,
      and set the fillStyle to that variable
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we've drawn an image on the canvas, we can use the getImageData
      method from the Canvas API to manipulate the pixels of that image.
    </p>
    <p>getImageData will return an ImageData object</p>
    <p>three properties: width, height, and data</p>
    <p>
      data contains information about the pixels in the ImageData object in the
      form of an array.
    </p>
    <p>Each pixel on the canvas will have four values in the data array</p>
    <p>correspond to that pixel's R, G, B, and A values</p>
